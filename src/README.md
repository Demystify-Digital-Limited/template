# Hello, World.

If you would like to create a new site, please delete this file and make sure there isn't anything else inside the `/src` folder.  
Then, you can edit some settings in `/env` folder, run `docker compose up -d`, and in a few minutes, a new site will be setup for you.

I would highly reccomend to change the `db.env` to match the credentails on the server to skip the headache of manually migrating data from your local machine to Coolify.  

GLHF!
